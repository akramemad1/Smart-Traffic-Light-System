To implement this algorithm, we applied the concept of FSM 
(Finate State Machine) to identify each state and its changes. 
• For each road we have 2 sensors, one at the beginning and the other at some distance from the first sensor, where we can detect: 
o The road is empty. 
o The road is Jammed. 
o The road is neither empty nor jammed. 
• At the beginning of the system, Road X1and X2 will be allowed to move for a short time then changes to yellow then red 
• The system checks the sensor inputs in the yellow state and determine whether the controller lid the red led for a short time or a long time 
• We open both X1 and X2 at the same time or Y1 and Y2 at the same time 
• Although our effort to reduce car accidents, there’s no guarantee that car accidents will not happen, that’s why we added a reset signal which turn all the red LEDs to block the streets. 
• Y1,Y2 is now opened and X1.X2 are closed 
• At the yellow state of Y1,Y2 The same sensor check happens to determine the waiting time at the red state (Long wait or short wait).
